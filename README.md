#  App Functions Pilot âœ¨

This project demonstrates the capabilities of **App Functions**, a new feature introduced in **Android 16 (API level 36)**. App Functions allow applications to expose their functionalities to the Android system, enabling cross-app orchestration. By leveraging this framework, developers can integrate large language models (LLMs) to create agentic experiences with tool-calling capabilities.

This repository contains two sample applications that illustrate a function-calling workflow, using the [`androidx.appfunctions`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/appfunctions) Jetpack library:

**Agent App**: Demonstrates how to discover functions registered by other apps, parse their declarations, and invoke them to retrieve results.

**Tool App**: Shows how to register and expose an app's own functions, making them available for other apps (like the Agent) to call.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following flag is enabled on your device or emulator:

```
adb shell aflags list | grep "enable_app_functions_schema_parser"
```

If this flag is not set to enabled, you will need to modify the `USE_CONTENT_PROVIDER` variable to true in the following file: `agent/src/main/java/dev/filipfan/appfunctionspilot/agent/MainViewModel.kt`.

### Tool App

You can install the tool app directly using ADB:

```
adb install tool-debug.apk
```

### Agent App

The agent app requires the `android.permission.EXECUTE_APP_FUNCTIONS` permission, which is a protected permission granted only to privileged system applications. To install the agent app, you'll need a rooted device or emulator.

1. **Disable Permission Enforcement**: First, modify the `build.prop` file to disable privileged permission enforcement.

```
adb root
adb remount
adb shell "sed -i 's/ro.control_privapp_permissions=enforce/ro.control_privapp_permissions=log/g' /vendor/build.prop"
```

2. **Install as a Privileged App**: Push the APK to the privileged apps directory, such as `/system/priv-app`:

```
adb push agent-debug.apk /system/priv-app
adb reboot
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> After the initial privileged installation, you can update the agent app using a standard `adb install` command, provided its permissions in the manifest do not change.
